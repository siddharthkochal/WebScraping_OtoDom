# WebScraping_OtoDom
Project Python applications

Webscraping:

Create a program that can extract information from housing aggregator websites like gratka.pl or otodom.pl. The program should be able to extract all the relevant data from a search query, such as location, minimum and maximum price, minimum and maximum area, and other important features. It should also include options for private or public ads. The extracted data should include the link to the record, price, number of rooms, area, description, other features, and position on a map. You can extract the position using Google Maps iframes.

 

Once you have extracted the data, use it to gain insights about a smaller town. The program should allow users to input the town they are interested in and then extract all the relevant information about available housing in that area. This will provide useful information for those who are looking to move to a new town or city, or for anyone who is interested in the housing market in a particular area.
